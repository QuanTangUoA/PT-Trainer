Project vision
The administrator of this PTFC system can manage all registered users, including personal trainers and clients. Each registration request from the personal trainer will be approved or rejected by the administrator to guarantee all personal trainers in the PTFC system are professionally certified. Also, the administrator can suspend or active users to ensure the quality of users. The personal trainers can use this system to advertise their services, communicate and connect with clients. The clients can use this system to browse for a range of the right personal trainers, communicate with them and make bookings with them. If the personal trainers accept client bookings, then clients can engage with them further on by using online chat or offline.
